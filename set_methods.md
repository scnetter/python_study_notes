# Set Methods

* `.difference()` - finds difference between two sets `my_set.difference(second_set)`
* `.discard()` - removes a value from the set.
* `.difference_update()` - Remove all elements of another set from calling set.
* `.intersectio()` - prints values that overlap in two sets. Shorthanded by `&`.
* `.isdisjoint()` - True/False response to whether sets overlap
* `.issubset()` - True/False response if is a subset.
* `.issuperset()` - True/False response if calling set is a superset or argument.
* `.union()` - joins two sets eliminating duplicates. Shorthanded by using `|`.
