# Python Study Notes

## General Random Notes
* Dictionary keys must be Hashable (immutable) and unique.
  * I.e. list objects cannot be a dictionary key
* Sets - unordered list of unique values. Denoted by `{}`. Can use `set(my_list)` to create a set from a list.
  * Sets are accessed by value, not index `if 1 in my_set`
